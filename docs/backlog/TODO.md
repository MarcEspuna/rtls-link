# Future work

1. Automatic position calculation of anchors
    - We can suppose a rectangular shape and use TWR on anchors in order to calculate it's position.
2. OTA
    - Special care needs to be taken regarding partitions. Keep in mind
3. Move current board definition to json objects that will define hw pinout and a file for preprocessor definitions.
4. Automatic calibration of antenna delay using 4 anchors and tags simultaneously.
    - Not sure how exactly it can be done and if it would be much useful. A lot of investigation needed.
